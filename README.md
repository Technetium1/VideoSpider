# FAQs

* Should I use an adblocker?
  * Yes! uBlock Origin is recommended. Install for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), then use these: [Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9877150/67312187-e7265480-f4ce-11e9-97f2-63578d4679a1.png) + [Block Lists](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9877150/102152146-6c429a80-3e42-11eb-8760-acc74ecb8a13.png)
  * If you visit non-English sites; scroll down in the blocklists to `Regions, languages` and include the relevant country codes.
* What is the season ID for?
  * You will probably never need to use this, except for the occasional TV series, so just don't enter one unless needed.
* Do I need Python installed to run this program?
  * No! You can download the latest exe from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Technetium1/VideoSpider/releases/latest).
* My video isn't loading, or pauses a lot, why?
  * Click the icon in the upper right to change sources, and/or scan for more. Not all sources are created equally.
* Can I download movies with this?
  * Sometimes players will have a download button in the bottom bar, switch sources until you see it.
* Where are the videos coming from?
  * "[VideoSpider](https://videospider.in) crawls various websites and search engines to find movie and TV episode streaming links which are then stored into our database and served to you through our API service."
* I made an account but I only see an API key, where is the Secret key?
  * You made a personal account and not a developer account, click the `change account type` link.
